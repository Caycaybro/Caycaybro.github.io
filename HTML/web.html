          Behind the beauty of the neon city's appearance, <br />
          such as beautiful buildings and colorful lights that soothe the eyes,
          <br />
          there are employees, workers who are working overtime in those
          buildings. <br />
          <br />

          But besides Neon City, <br />
          there's something equally important that you need to know... &#10145;

        So... &#128513;<br />
        The story goes... <br />
        Back then... <br />
        There was a person's child, who told me that she really loved the night
        view from above &#127811;, looking down upon a cluster of cities with numerous and
        beautiful building lights and stars  &#127747;.
      </p>
      <p class="fade-in-right">
        She also mentioned it again while we were  &#127949; descending a road towards my
        house  &#127960;, but... <br /> &#9203;
        it would take her approximately another year to return to her
        hometown and witness it again with me. <br />
        Because of that, it gave me the
        idea to give this website a Luminous Cityscape theme.
        
      </p>
      <p class="fade-in-left">
       (So.... Hurry up &#9992;, come back here quickly... <br /> &#128534;
        Don't stay there for too long, there are people who miss you, not me :v,
        but also your parents and other friends &#128521;.  )
      </p>
     
    </div>
<footer style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.5rem;"> <p >If i think back, I miss you a lot. Take good care of yourself there. I didn't ask directly, at that time, I didn't want my worry to become a bother to you. So Don't forget to share your story, so that I don't have to worry and can be calmer(at least i know) - MF</p></footer>
